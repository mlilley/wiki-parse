He was the last [[Emperor of India]] and the first [[Head of the Commonwealth]].\n\nKnown publicly as Albert until his accession, and \"Bertie\" among his family and close friends, George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]], and was named after his great-grandfather [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. As the second son of [[King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He attended naval college as a teenager, and served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[First World War]]. In 1920, he was made [[Duke of York]]. He married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923 and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. In the mid-1920s, he had [[speech therapy]] for a [[stammer]], which he never fully overcame.\n\nGeorge's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. However, later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king. [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated to marry Simpson]], and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].\n\nDuring George's reign, the break-up of the [[British Empire]] and its transition into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] accelerated. The parliament of the [[Irish Free State]] [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed]] direct mention of the monarch from [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|the country's constitution]] on the day of his accession. The following year, a [[Constitution of Ireland|new Irish constitution]] changed the name of the state to Ireland and established the office of [[President of Ireland|President]]. From 1939, the Empire and Commonwealth&nbsp;– except Ireland&nbsp;– was at [[World War II|war]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. War with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. Though [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] rose as pre-eminent [[superpower|world powers]] and the British Empire declined. After the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947, George remained king of both countries, but relinquished the title of ''Emperor of India'' in June 1948. Ireland [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|formally declared itself a republic]] and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, Elizabeth II.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Edward VII UK and successors.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Four kings: Edward VII (far right), his son George, Prince of Wales, later George V (far left), and grandsons Edward, later Edward VIII (rear), and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908]]\n\nGeorge was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Rhodes James, p. 90; Weir, p. 329</ref> His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later [[King George V]]), the second and eldest-surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]]).

He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as [[genu valgum|knock knees]], for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.<ref name=\"matthew\">{{citation|first=H. C.

Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.
